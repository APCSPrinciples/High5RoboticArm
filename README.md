# Build a "High 5" Robotic Arm
TBD   
### Step 1: Build the circuit
Our Robotic Arm will use the following parts:
- Servo
- 10KΩ resistor
- Photoresistor
- Jumper wires   

Use the pictures from the previous project to make sure you are using correct 10KΩ resistor and photoresistor   

Use the following circuit diagram to construct the circuit. The direction of the photoresistor and the 10KΩ resistor is unimportant.

### Step 2: Test the circuit
TBD

### Step 3: Write the program
TBD   


### Step 4: Submit your finished program
Have your teacher or a TA verify that you have a working program. Submit your finished program by uploading the .sb file to Google classroom. You should be able to find it in *My Documents | Scratch Projects*. If you worked with a partner, each partner should submit a copy of the finished program to Google classroom.
